This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.


Testing locally
===============

Start a BentoBox. Create an instance named `default` and create a couple
of tables however you'd like.

In your terminal, run `play`

Then type `run`
A server will run on http://localhost:9000

Scala code will be recompiled every time you change it, and you access a URL.


Other targets are `clean`, `test`, `help`...
